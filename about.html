                <h3>E learning</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right" width="300">
                </p>
                <p>Quite simply, e-learning is electronic learning, and typically this means using a computer to deliver part, or all of a course whether it's in a school, part of your mandatory business training or a full distance learning course.

In the early days it received a bad press, as many people thought bringing computers into the classroom would remove that human element that some learners need, but as time has progressed technology has developed, and now we embrace smartphones and tablets in the classroom and office, as well as using a wealth of interactive designs that makes distance learning not only engaging for the users, but valuable as a lesson delivery medium.

Building partnerships with quality training providers, and combining this with a dedicated experienced technical team and support staff, Virtual College provides the perfect blended learning environment, offering anyone the chance to take their online training to the next level.</p>
                <h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
                <strong>It's cost effective and saves time:</strong>
                <p>By reducing the time taken away from the office, removing travel costs and doing away with printed materials, online learning helps you to save money and increase workplace productivity. It also means your staff will be happier and focussed.</p>
                <strong>Learning 24/7, anywhere:</strong>
                <p>Many face to face courses only operate within normal office hours. By allowing staff to complete the course when and where they like you can make sure disruptions to your busy working schedule are minimised. This also means that your staff will be happier because they don't need to travel to specific training centres, and if they have important work to catch up on mandatory training can be done outside of office hours in exchange for lieu time. Most of our courses have an average learning time, and our CPD approved courses allow learners to print out certificates of proof.</p>
                <strong>It's discreet:</strong>
                
                <p>Not everybody feels comfortable learning in a large group, especially if they find something hard to understand that co-workers have no problem with. E-learning allows each individual to tackle the subject at their own pace, with interactive tasks being set in place to ensure a thorough understanding throughout each module.</p>
